DIFFUSION MODELS - MY UNDERSTANDING (Day 1)

1. What is a diffusion model?
Inspired by thermodynamics in equilibrium, diffusion models add noise to original data step by step to get a complete noise and then learn to remove that noise to get back that original data. It learns to predict noise and remove it to get realistic data. 

2. What does forward process do?
It adds noise to the data gradually step by step by adding gaussian nose to eventually convert a sample to complete noise 

2. What does reverse process do?
It reverse the noising steps and remove the noise to create original sample 

3. What does the neural network learn?
The added noise 

4. How do we generate new samples?
Sampling random noise and removinging noise from it 

5. What am I still confused about?
- The probability math
- The notation 
- The equations 

6. What makes sense?
- The big picture of adding/removing noise
- predicting noise instead of sample
